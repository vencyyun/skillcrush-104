			<h4>Confusion happens when you have an overproductive garden! What to do with Mushrooms?</h4>
			<p>Mushrooms are excellent served with japanese eggplant. These long legged beauties in their purple skins are delicately tender and pale when cut open.</p>

			<p>Harvest them in summer, when they are the most productive, often each plant produces 4 kilos, long and thin, they spring from the node of it's purple flower.</p>

			<p>I love a splash of soy sauce, maple syrup, seasame oil, fried up with some fresh shitaki mushrooms. I salivate thinking about them.</p>
			<h4>The best eggplant companion</h4>
			<p>Serve it all on a bed of brown whole grain rice</p>

			<p>Don't forget to dunk your eggplant in more dipping sauce</p>
